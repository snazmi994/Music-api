Shanjana's Music Database

For my second project at General Assembly, we were  tasked to create a full-stack application that incorporated a database like structure. For my library, I decided to make it music themed. In this back end repository involves all of my api related codes. I thoruoughly enjoyed coding the backend API and troubleshooting.

Technologies and methods I intend to use:

API 2. JAVASCRIPT 3. MONGOOSE 4. GITHUB 5. ATOM

ERD MAP:

Album

title : string
artist : string
fav_song : string
owner : ref user
